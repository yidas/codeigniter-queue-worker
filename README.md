DEMONSTRATION
-------------

Running a listener with 2~5 workers setting added per 3 seconds:

```
$ php index.php job_controller/listen
2018-10-06 14:36:28 - Queue Listener - Job detect
2018-10-06 14:36:28 - Queue Listener - Start dispatch
2018-10-06 14:36:28 - Queue Listener - Dispatch Worker #1 (PID: 13254)
2018-10-06 14:36:28 - Queue Listener - Dispatch Worker #2 (PID: 13256)
2018-10-06 14:36:31 - Queue Listener - Dispatch Worker #3 (PID: 13266)
2018-10-06 14:36:34 - Queue Listener - Job empty
2018-10-06 14:36:34 - Queue Listener - Stop dispatch, total cost: 6.00s
```

---

REQUIREMENTS
------------
This library requires the following:

- PHP CLI 5.4.0+
- CodeIgniter 3.0.0+

---

INSTALLATION
------------

Run Composer in your Codeigniter project under the folder `\application`:

    composer require yidas/codeigniter-queue-worker
    
Check Codeigniter `application/config/config.php`:

```php
$config['composer_autoload'] = TRUE;
```
    
> You could customize the vendor path into `$config['composer_autoload']`

---

CONFIGURATION
-------------

You need to design porcesses for your own worker inherited from this library, there are common interfaces as following:

```php
use yidas\queue\worker\Controller as WorkerController;

class My_worker extends WorkerController
{
    // Initializer
    protected function init() {}
    
    // Listener
    protected function listenerCallback() {}
    
    // Worker
    protected function workerCallback() {}
}
```

You need to develop the queue processer by your own and then encapsulate it into the queue worker controller, which this worker library detects jobs by your callback result. 

For example, you could develop memory cache queue to handle the listener and worker callbacks. In other words, your processes for listener and worker both detect jobs from same job queue such as Redis queue.


### How to Design a Worker

#### 1. Build Initializer

```php
protected void init()
```

*Example Code:*
```php
class My_worker extends \yidas\queue\worker\Controller
{
    protected function init()
    {
        // Optional autoload 
        $this->load->library('myjobs');

        // Optional shared properties setting
        $this->static = 'static value';
    }
// ...
```

#### 2. Build Listener

```php
protected boolean listenCallback(object $static=null)
```

*Example Code:*
```php
class My_worker extends \yidas\queue\worker\Controller
{
    protected function listenCallback()
    {
        // `true` for job existing
        return $this->myjobs->exists();
    }
// ...
```

#### 3. Build Worker

```php
protected boolean workCallback(object $static=null)
```

*Example Code:*
```php
class My_worker extends \yidas\queue\worker\Controller
{
    protected function workCallback()
    {
        // `false` for job not found
        return $this->myjobs->processJob();
    }
// ...
```

### Porperties Setting

You could customize your worker by defining properties.

```php
use yidas\queue\worker\Controller as WorkerController;

class My_worker extends WorkerController
{
    // Setting for that a listener only fork a worker
    // Setting to 1 could prevent race condition depended on your queue structure
    public $workerMaxNum = 1;
    
    // Enable text log writen into specified file
    public $logPath = 'tmp/my-worker.log';
}
```

#### Public Properties

|Property          |Type     |Deafult      |Description|
|:--               |:--      |:--          |:--        |
|$debug            |boolean  |true         |Debug mode |
|$logPath          |string   |null         |Log file path|
|$phpCommand       |string   |'php'        |PHP CLI command for current environment|
|$listenerSleep    |integer  |3            |Time interval of listen frequency on idle|
|$workerSleep      |integer  |0            |Time interval of worker processes frequency|
|$workerMaxNum     |integer  |5            |Number of max workers|
|$workerStartNum   |integer  |1            |Number of workers at start, less than or equal to $workerMaxNum|
|$workerWaitSeconds|integer  |10           |Waiting time between worker started and next worker starting|
|$workerHeathCheck |boolean  |true         |Enable worker health check for listener|

USAGE
-----

There are 3 actions for usage:

- `listen` A listener to manage and dispatch jobs by forking workers.
- `work` A worker to process and solve jobs from queue.
- `launch` A launcher to run `listen` or `work` process in background and keep it running uniquely.

After configurating a queue-worker, it is ready to run:

```
$ php index.php myjob/listen
```

Listener would continuously call listener callback funciton, it would dispatch jobs by forking workers while the callback return `true` which means that there has job(s) detected.

Each worker would continuously call worker callback funciton till returning `false`, which means that there are no job detected from the worker. 

Also, the worker `work` could be called by CLI, which the listener is calling the same CLI to fork a worker:

```
$ php index.php myjob/work
```

### Running in Background

#### Launcher

To run Listener or Worker in the background, you could call Launcher to launch process:

```
$ php index.php myjob/launch
```

By default, Launcher would launch `listen` process, you could also lauch `work` by giving parameter:

```
$ php index.php myjob/launch/worker
```

Launcher could keep launching process running uniquely, which prevents multiple same listeners or workers running at the same time. For example, the first time to launch a listener:

```
$ php index.php myjob/launch
Success to launch process `listen`: myjob/listen.
Called command: php /srv/ci-project/index.php myjob/listen > /dev/null &
user 14089  0.0  0.4 288200 20156 pts/2    R+   15:25   0:00 php /srv/ci-project/index.php myjob/listen
```

Then, when you launch the listener again, Launcher would prevent repeated running:

```
$ php index.php myjob/launch
Skip: Same process `listen` is running: myjob/listen.
user 14089  0.6  0.9 337764 36496 pts/2    S    15:25   0:00 php /srv/ci-project/index.php myjob/listen
```

#### Process Status

After launching a listener, you could check the listener service by command `ps aux|grep php`:

```
...
www-data  2278  0.7  1.0 496852 84144 ?        S    Sep25  37:29 php-fpm: pool www
www-data  3129  0.0  0.4 327252 31064 ?        S    Sep10   0:34 php /srv/ci-project/index.php myjob/listen
...
```

According to above, you could manage listener and workers such as killing listener by command `kill 3129`.

Workers would run while listener detected job, the running worker processes would also show in `ps aux|grep php`.

> Manually, you could also use an `&` (an ampersand) at the end of the listener or worker to run in the background.
